//		Java Lambda Expression Crash Course - By Ramesh Fadatare (Java Guides)
		
//	  Q.What is Lambda Expression?
//		  ->Lambda expressions were introduced in Java 8
//		  ->Lambda expression is an anonymous function. It's a function without name and doesn't belong
//			to any class.
//		  ->Lambda expression is mainly used to implement functional interfaces.
		
//	  Q.What are Functional Interfaces?
//		  ->Functional interfaces were introduced in Java 8
//		  ->An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as a functional interface
//		  ->Functional interface can have any number of default, static methods but can contain only 
//			one abstract method.
		
//		Lambda Expression is different from Method.
//			Method is always belongs to class or object in java where as Lambda does not belongs to any
//		class or object.
//		Method has the main parts:
//			-Name
//			-Parameter/Arguments list
//			-Body
//			-Return type
//		For Ex:
//		public int addition(int a, int b) {
//			return a+b;
//		}
		
//		Lambda expression has these main parts:
//			-No Name - As Lambda is an anonymous function so no need to have a name.
//			-Parameter List
//			-Body - This is the main part of the function
//			-No Return type - You don't need to mention the return type in Lambda Expression. The java 8+
//		compiler will infer the return type by checking the code.
//		For Ex:
//		Addable withLambda = (int a, int b) -> (a+b);
