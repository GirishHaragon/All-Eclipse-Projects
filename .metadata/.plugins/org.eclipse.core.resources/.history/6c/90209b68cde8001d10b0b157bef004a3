So we should understand that by this a DataStructure gets created with a Initial size of 10indexes. After storing 10 elements in it, the size of the array increase to 15 automatically/dynamically that is 1.5x of initial size. And all the values stored based on the index no.
		x.add(10);//To store the values as objects inside array we have built-in method add().
		x.add(20);//This add() method will return boolean value.
		x.add(new Integer(10));//The values are getting wrapped into Integer Wrapper class & getting stored into array indexes as Objects(Integer). This is called as Boxing.
		x.add(30);//Here also it is happening to be Boxing.
		//That's why ArrayList is a Collection. And Collection is a group of objects.
		//That means, whatever values we r storing r not just primitive data, but actually converting those values into Objects & putting inside index of array.
		//Now we can see a lot of warnings because of not using Generics in our ArrayList.
		
		//We can store heterogeneous values in ArrayList when no generic is applied, but that's not a good practice.
		x.add("Pankaj");//We don't get any error for heterogeneous values insertion.
		x.add(true);
		x.add(10.3);
