@Entity //Entity class is a Special class, these classes are mapped to the table of DB. Moment we write @Entity Spring Boot will automatically based on the name will search for the table in the DB & connect with that, Thats why we should give the same table name as in DB. & Spring boot automatically does the work of mapping.
//It'll automatically do it, that's y we have given the name same, u apply this annotation and it will make this an entity class which means this class is mapped to the DB table, but how is this getting mapped, bcs the table name and the class name r same.
public class Student {//Now we need to have the variables matching to the DB table..  
	private int id;
	private String name;
	private String course;
	private int fee;
	
	//& Now this is where we are achieving Encapsulation here..
